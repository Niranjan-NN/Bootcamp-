## 3️⃣ **Middleware Demonstration**

### 📝 Overview  
Showcase the use of custom and built-in middleware in Express.js.

### 🚀 What I Learned  
- 🏷️ **Middleware Flow:** Understood how requests pass through middleware.
- ⚙️ **Custom Middleware:** Created functions to log requests.
- 🧩 **Error Handling:** Handled errors gracefully.

### 🛠️ Installation Procedure
1. Create project folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir middleware-demo && cd middleware-demo
   npm init -y
   npm install express
   ```
2. Add custom middleware functions in `server.js`.
3. Start the server to see middleware in action.
