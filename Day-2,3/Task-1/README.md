# 📄 Personal Info Webpage

## 📝 Overview  
A simple webpage displaying my information with a picture, built using basic HTML tags.

## 🚀 What I Learned  
In this project, I used the following HTML tags:  

- **`<html>`:** Defines the root of the HTML document.  
- **`<head>`:** Contains meta-information like the page title.  
- **`<title>`:** Sets the title shown on the browser tab.  
- **`<body>`:** Contains all the visible content on the webpage.  
- **`<h1>`:** Used for the main heading. 
- **`<p>`:** Used for adding paragraphs describing myself.  
- **`<img>`:** Displays my picture on the webpage.
