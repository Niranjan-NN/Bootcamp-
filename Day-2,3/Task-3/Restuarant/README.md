# 🍽️ Restaurant Website

## 📝 Overview  
A structured multi-page **Restaurant Website** featuring a menu, sections, and clear formatting using HTML.

## 🚀 What I Learned  
In this project, I used the following HTML concepts and tags:  

- **`<html>`:** Defines the structure of all pages.  
- **`<head>` & `<title>`:** Provides meta information and sets page titles.  
- **`<body>`:** Contains visible content like sections and menus.  
- **`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`:** Used for the restaurant name, menu categories, and item names.  
- **`<p>`:** Describes dishes, restaurant information, and contact details.  
- **`<img>`:** Displays images of dishes and the restaurant.  
- **`<ul>`, `<li>`:** Lists menu items and features.  
- **`<a>`:** Links different pages (e.g., Home, Menu, About Us, Contact) for multi-page navigation.  
- **`<nav>`:** Provides a navigation bar for smooth page connectivity.  

## 🌐 Website Structure  
- **Home Page:** Introduction and restaurant highlights.  
- **Menu Page:** Structured food categories with images and descriptions.  
- **About Us Page:** Restaurant story and team details.  
- **Contact Page:** Location, phone number, and a contact form.
