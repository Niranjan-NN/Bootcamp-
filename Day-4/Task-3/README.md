## 📝 Overview  
A **webpage** that displays **one image at a time** with controls to **cycle through multiple images** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🚀 What I Learned  

### 🏷️ **HTML Concepts:**  
- **`<img>`:** Displayed images dynamically.  
- **`<button>`:** Created "Next" and "Previous" controls for navigation.  
- **`<div>` & `<section>`:** Structured the image container and control buttons.  

### 🎨 **CSS Concepts:**  
- Styled the image container for proper alignment and spacing.  
- Added hover effects to buttons for better interactivity.  
- Used responsive design to ensure the carousel works on all devices.  

### ⚙️ **JavaScript Functionality:**  
- Implemented **event listeners** on buttons to handle image changes.  
- Used an **array of image sources** to manage the images.  
- Handled **edge cases** (looping back to the first image after the last one).  
- Added **smooth transitions** between images.
